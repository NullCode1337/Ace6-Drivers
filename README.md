# OxygenOS Drivers for OnePlus Ace 6
As we all know, PLQ110 will never receive a global variant (like PLR110), so it won't get proper OxygenOS.

This module fixes all known issues with [OxygenOS Ports for Ace 6](https://roms.danielspringer.at/index.php?dir=Oneplus+Ace+6%2FOxygenOS+Flashers)

## What's Different?
- Fixed incorrect battery capacity
- Fixed screen dimming for udfps
- Fixed HDR brightness
- Restore Dolby Vision code
- Restore default minimum brightness
- Allow using OOS my_region (AI features and networking now work)

## Installation
- Install with KernelSU / [SukiSU Ultra](https://t.me/op15chat/30123) ([Metamodule](https://github.com/Hybrid-Mount/meta-hybrid_mount) recommended)
- Flashing with [OrangeFox](https://github.com/NullCode1337/android_device_orangefox_ktm/releases/latest) is also possible
