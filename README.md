# OnePlus Ace 6 Drivers for OxygenOS
As we all know PLQ110 will never receive a global variant (like PLR110), so it won't get proper OxygenOS.

This module fixes all known issues with the [OxygenOS ports for Ace 6](https://roms.danielspringer.at/index.php?dir=Oneplus+Ace+6%2FSuper+Duper+Testbuilds)

## What's Different?
- Fixed incorrect battery capacity
- Fixed screen dimming for udfps
- Fixed HDR brightness
- Restore Dolby Vision code
- Restore default minimum brightness
- Allow using OOS my_region (AI features and networking now work)

## Installation
- Flash with KernelSU / SukiSU Ultra (with metamodule)
- Flashing with [OrangeFox](https://github.com/NullCode1337/android_orangefox_PLQ110/releases/latest) is also possible

## Thanks
- @koaaN (Jonas Salo) - Created the ports, pointed me around on what to fix
- Yakayan, Raphael - Ace 6 testers
